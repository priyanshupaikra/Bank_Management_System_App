üîí Security Features
Password Hashing: User passwords are never stored in plain text. We use werkzeug.security to hash passwords upon registration and verify them at login.
Email Validation: Emails are validated for correct formatting during registration.
Session Management: User sessions are handled securely by Flask-Login, which uses cryptographically signed cookies to prevent session tampering.
CSRF Protection: All forms are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks automatically by Flask-WTF.
